- 👋 Hi, I’m @MiriamRGarcia
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical models describing bacterial growth and death with antimicrobials using (ordinary, partial, stochastic) differential equations
    - Examples in Zenodo of models I have been working on
        - 📁 [Kinetics of E. coli inactivation by benzalkonium chloride](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1207616) 
        - 📁 ["Model-based design of smart active packaging systems with antimicrobial activity" Matlab codes](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3244153)
        - 📁 [Temperature simulator of fish stored in tubs and boxes (FishT-TaB Simulator)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3725615)

    - Examples in Zenodo of databases
        - 📉 ["Model-based design of smart active packaging systems with antimicrobial activity" Matlab codes](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4297015)

    - On-going Webpage with models and data
        - 👉[Microracle](https://microracle.shinyapps.io/Microracle/)  

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related with dynamic modelling of bacterial growth and death.
