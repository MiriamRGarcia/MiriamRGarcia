- 👋 Hi, I’m @MiriamRGarcia, I’m interested in **mathematical models describing bacterial growth and death with antimicrobials** using (ordinary, partial, stochastic) differential equations
- Models (🖳), Data (📈) Models&Data (🖳📈) I have been working on
      - 🖳 [Smart active packaging with antimicrobials](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3244153)
      - 📈 [Studied disinfectant substances against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4297015)
      - 📈 [A systematic review on fish freshness and quality indicators](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6400471)
      - 🖳📈 [Inactivation coli&cereus with sub-MIC Carvacrol](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6656085)
      - 🖳📈 [Inactivation coli&cereus with Sub-MIC DDAC](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.5167910)
      - 🖳 [Inactivation coli with BAC](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.1207616) 
      - 🖳📈 [Inactivation Listeria with BAC](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6651603)
        
- Tools (🔧) working in collaboration with [EFSA](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en)
      - 🔧 [FishT-TaB Simulator: Temperature simulator of fish stored in tubs and boxes](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3725615)
      - 🔧 [HTM-SFFP Tool: Heat transfer superchilled fresh fishery products](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4304282)


- (On-going work) 🌐  [Microracle](https://microracle.shinyapps.io/Microracle/)  Webpage with models (🖳) and data (📈)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related with dynamic modelling of bacterial growth and death.
